## Major Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Candlestick Patterns File**
- Removed duplicate function definitions for `three_candles_bull` and `three_candles_bear`
- Renamed to `three_white_soldiers` and `three_black_crows` for clarity
- Added 14 new advanced candlestick patterns with proper mathematical logic

### 2. **Comprehensive Pattern Recognition**
- **62 total pattern features** (was 24)
- **22 custom patterns** from enhanced file
- **14 new advanced patterns** (hammer, doji variants, star patterns, etc.)
- **23 TA-Lib patterns** for maximum coverage
- **3 pattern aggregation features** for overall market sentiment

### 3. **Enhanced Technical Analysis**
- More robust datetime handling for context features
- Better type safety and error handling
- Comprehensive pattern strength indicators

## Benefits of Enhancements

1. **Massive Pattern Coverage**: 62 candlestick patterns for comprehensive market analysis
2. **Improved Black Swan Detection**: Advanced patterns specifically designed for extreme moves
3. **Better Signal Quality**: Pattern aggregation features provide market sentiment
4. **Enhanced Robustness**: Fixed bugs and improved error handling
5. **Production Ready**: Type-safe, optimized code with comprehensive validation

## Usage

The enhanced pipeline maintains backward compatibility through the `FeaturePipeline` wrapper class while providing the new `BlackSwanFeaturePipeline` with all enhancements.

```python
from src.features.black_swan_pipeline import BlackSwanFeaturePipeline

# Initialize enhanced pipeline
pipeline = BlackSwanFeaturePipeline()

# Generate enhanced XGBoost features (~60 features)
xgb_features = pipeline.generate_xgb_features(df, symbol)

# Generate enhanced LSTM features (~15 features)
lstm_features = pipeline.generate_lstm_features(df, symbol)
```

The enhanced features should significantly improve the Black Swan Hunter's ability to detect extreme price movements and tail events in M5 forex data.
